	/// \brief A generic, priority-based asynchronous arbitration node.
	///
    /// This generic node can be used to arbitrate command feeds with
    /// different update periods.
    /// See the default, synchronized version for details on front end usage.
	///
	/// The node publishes a command with the highest priority value on the 
    /// "abtr_cmd" topic as soon as it is received by the front end module(s). 
    /// A command becomes invalid when its age is beyond the given time period.
    /// This is the "period" parameter (default: 1.00 s).
    /// This validity is verified periodically, at every "abtr_period" seconds
    /// (default: 0.1 s).
	/// Publication starts with the first valid command, and completely stops if
	/// every command has been deactivated.
	/// A good practice is to initialize the arbitration node with a default,
	/// safe command at priority 0.
    /// A command at priority 0 has infinite lifetime.
	///
	/// This class is an union of both the Frontend and AsyncBackend classes in 
    /// their default configuration with ShapeShifters for topic types.
